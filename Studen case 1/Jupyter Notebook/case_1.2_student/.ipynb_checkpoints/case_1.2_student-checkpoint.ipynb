While you can build a basic data table (similar to an Excel spreadsheet) using nested lists in Python, they get quite difficult to work with. By contrast, in `pandas` the table data structure, known as a `DataFrame`, is a first-class citizen and you can easily manipulate your data thinking of it in rows and columns.\n",

It is critical you become as familiar with ```pandas``` as possible and it is imperative that you continue researching/investigating new components of this library after the completion of this program. What we have taught here are only the essential basics of `pandas`; there is still a vast amount of power to the library that you will discover and utilize later on in your development as a data professional.\n",

    "We highly recommend revisiting this case a few more times and going through it from beginning to end with no aid/answers. You should know the various DataFrame/Series methods we introduced here as well as how to carry out common operations on data, such as finding percentiles, before you consider yourself to have \"mastered\" this material."
